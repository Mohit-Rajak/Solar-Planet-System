 #Excited to Share My Latest Project: Solar Planet Visualization!
Iâ€™m thrilled to showcase my recent project where Iâ€™ve created a visual representation of our solar system using HTML and CSS. ðŸš€ðŸŒŒ

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview:
I've designed a dynamic and interactive model of the solar system, featuring the Sun and all the major planets. This project aims to provide a visually engaging way to explore the relative sizes and positions of celestial bodies.

ðŸ”¹ Design Highlights:

Layout: Planets are arranged in orbits to mimic their positions in the solar system.
Styling: Utilized CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive and flexible layouts.
Animations: Added smooth transitions to simulate planet rotation and orbit movement.
ðŸ”¹ Technical Details:

HTML Structure: Clean and semantic, using <div> and <section> for clear organization.
CSS Techniques: Employed modern CSS features, including media queries for responsiveness and keyframe animations for interactive elements.
* Challenges & Solutions:
Faced challenges with aligning elements perfectly across different devices. Resolved these by leveraging CSS Flexbox and Grid systems for better alignment and responsiveness.

ðŸ”¹ Future Enhancements:
Looking forward to integrating JavaScript for interactive features and adding more detailed information about each planet.
